This a collection of my personal bash and terminal scripts that I find usefull

- `export-task` A complementary bash scripts for `dhth/hours`, made for easier pipelining and data visualization.
- `organize`    A simple script that recursively organizes documents.
- `task-data` Meant to be used with `export-task' in a pipeline. Displays basic statistics
